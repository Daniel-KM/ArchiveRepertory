TODO for "Archive Repertory" (plugin for Omeka)
===============================================

* Checks names of folders and files and appends item or file id if needed to
avoid names collisions.
* Extends the collection class with the folder name and with settings.
* Adds a field or an element for folder of the item?
* Manages old files when collection folder changes.
* Adds tests.
